# Snake Game

SnakeGame is my implementation of classic game called "Snake". It's arcade game where the player controls a line which grows in length. The player controls a square object on plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. Player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border. When snake runs into itself, player lost tail and all points. 

### Usage
To start game press space. Control the snake you have to click UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keys. When the snake hit into a wall, player can press space to play again or ESC to quit.
